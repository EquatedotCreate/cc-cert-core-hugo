Understanding the differences between Creative Commons licenses is important, but how do you deal with situations where you create content from materials that have different licenses?

## The Big Question

Open content and open educational resources do not have one, universal copyright conditions. If you saw or used any Creative Commons content (or under other free licenses) you probably noticed that many of their conditions rule out the others. So how do mix them to create something that will be open and won’t break the internet (and someone's copyright)?

Exclusive conditions allow people to choose perfect licenses, adjusted to their needs but it also influence a lot, how this work will be used.

Creative Commons licenses are designed for ease of use. Users can see in a transparent manner how your work is available for reuse. Things can become complicated however if you want to combine two Creative Commons licensed works, for example when making a collage or remixes of music. *Not all licenses are in fact to compatible.* 

Knowing how to mix different licenses is crucial for making new content safe, useful and successful. 

## Learning Outcomes

* Compare compatibility between licenses
* Determine license compatibility/interoperability
* Avoid license incompatibility
* Understand Creative Commons remix chart
* Understand license stacking
* Understand Non-Creative Commons license compatibility


## Personal Reflection / Why It Matters to You  
  
How do you search for Creative Commons licensed content? Do you start with selecting the license or you look for the content first and then narrow it down according to license? How often do you see materials you would like to combine that are under different licenses? Do you even bother to check the license during your research?

Try to remember your strategies, questions or problems you have encountered when using different content under Creative Commons licenses.

Choose two works you wish to combine or remix. Find the license of the first work on the first row and the license on the first column. You can combine the works if there is a check mark in the cell where the row and column intersect. Use at least the most restrictive licensing of the two (use the license most to right or down state) for the new work. 

If there a cross at the intersection of the row and column then you can not just these works. This probably indicates that one of the two licenses may not used for commercial purposes, or one of the licenses does not allow for derivative works to be created

### Remix works with a Non-Commercial building block

It is not possible to mix works where the first work is placed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license and the second work is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. The ShareAlike building block in first license requires that the newly created work is released under that license and can therefore be used commercially, the second license wants you to release the new work under a license that does not permit commercial use.

### Remix work with a No-Derivative building block
It is not possible to use in a remix where No-Derivative is a building block in processing a work. All works have been released under this License may only be distributed. Into their original form There may of these works so no cropping or lower resolution works be made available. May also (parts of) these works are not used for other works.

You can see from the graph below how specific conditions affect not only one resource potential but at scale how they can grow the free culture.

Also, try the [OER Remix Game](http://indstudy1.org/univ/355460515034/Flash/Lesson2/PracticeVersion.html) where you have to remix four differently licensed  text, images, music, and video to create a new copyright compliant resource (requires Flash).

## Application of Learning

CC Certificates aim to support participants in direct application of learning for personal and / or professional use. This requires authoring learning activities that engage learners in using and applying the basic knowledge they acquire from content we provide. 

For each learning unit three learning activities need to be authored. 1. Creation of a personal learner toolkit. 2 Active participation in CC’s community, and 3. Applied practice. Here are guidelines for each:


### Learner Toolkit
Select at least 2 or 3 resources directly relevant to your personal or work related CC needs from the Acquiring Basic Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Adding them to your toolkit makes it easy to find and use them when the need arises and makes it easy for you to pass on resources you consider important to others. Add comments explaining relevancy and importance. 

### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude
In the CC Certificate social forum post your answers to the personal reflection questions posed at the start of this learning unit. Identify and comment on posts from at least two others who have similar needs or ideas.

Sign up for at least two means of connecting with Creative Commons such as following on Twitter, joining mailing lists of interest, subscribing to the Creative Commons newsletter, and joining the Creative Commons Slack channel.

From the Creative Commons news blog, Facebook page, Twitter stream and web pages identify at least two other people or organizations who are using Creative Commons in a similar way you or your organization do or want to do. Note these people or organizations in your Toolkit along with questions you might have for them in concerning advice or lessons learne

### Applied Practice


Complete the following activity in the Quest Bank:

* [Wikipedia, NC and Citation Test](https://quests.creativecommons.org/assignments/wikipedia-nc-and-citation)


## Closing the Loop

Generally, a modification rises to the level of an adaptation under copyright law when the modified work is based on the prior work but manifests sufficient new creativity to be copyrightable, such as a translation of a novel from one language to another, or the creation of a screenplay based on a novel. If your use is not one that requires permission under the license, you may conduct text and data mining activity without regard to the above considerations. the minute you put pen to paper, take a photo, or hit the 'save' button on your computer).


The first question to ask is whether doing so constitutes an adaptation. CC has a brief guide to interpretation of the NC license that goes into more detail about the meaning of the NC license and some key points to pay attention to. 

Because there is no single 'Creative Commons license,' it is important to identify which of the six licenses you are applying to your material, which of the six licenses has been applied to material that you intend to use, and in both cases the specific version. Embedding machine-readable metadata in the code of the license indicator or code of the licensed page.
