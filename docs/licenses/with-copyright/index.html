<p>A 1-2 sentence catchy teaser, usually as opening to the big question that follows. All content is <a href="https://cogdog.github.io/cc-ipsum/">CC-IP-SUM rubbish</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-question">The Big Question</h2>

<p>If you are looking for material offered under a Creative Commons license, CC Search is a good starting point. The database model refers to how a database is structured and organized, including database tables and table indexes. When a CC license is applied to a database, what is being licensed? You should also not apply Creative Commons licenses to works that are no longer protected by copyright or are otherwise in the public domain. Many rights holders who are members of a collecting society can waive the right to collect royalties for uses allowed under the license, but only to the extent their societies allow.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-core/blob/master/images/commons/copyright-iain.jpg" alt="Copyright Iain" title="Copyright Iain" /></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/iain/4804390638/">Copyright Iain</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/iain/">Iain Farrell</a> licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC BY-ND</a></em></p>

<p>Additionally, when you are using a work that is an adaptation of one or more pre-existing works, you may need to give credit to the creator(s) of the pre-existing work(s), in addition to giving credit to the creator of the adaptation. If you are unsure, you should either contact the rights holder for clarification, or search for works that permit commercial uses. All licenses after version 1.0 also allow you to license your contributions under a later version of the same license, and some also allow ported licenses. Some examples of collecting societies include ASCAP and BMI (United States), BUMA/STEMRA (Netherlands), PRS (United Kingdom), and APRA (Australia). You may apply a 4.0 license to material subject to any of those rights, whether or not the material is also subject to copyright.</p>

<p>Often, the database provider is not the original author of the database contents. However, we do not recommend this. (See above for more detail about how past versions of CC licenses vary with respect to sui generis database rights.)They provide basic information, sometimes about fairly complex topics, and will often link to more detailed information. If you do, you should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving multiple copyrights under different terms so that downstream users are aware of their obligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders.</p>

<p>Be sure to confirm that the material you want to use is actually under a CC license, as search results may sometimes be misleading. All of the ported licenses are at version 3.0 or earlier, which means licensors using those licenses do not have the benefit of the improvements made in the 4.0 license suite. All CC licenses require users to attribute the creator of licensed material, unless the creator has waived that requirement, not supplied a name, or asked that her name be removed. Unless you have a specific reason to use a ported license, we suggest you consider using one of the international licenses. CC offers some additional information on how CC licenses may affect your moral rights.</p>

<p>This compatibility mechanism is designed for situations in which content is integrated into software code in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to distinguish the two. There are special considerations required before using this compatibility mechanism. Licensors are not required to use the CC license chooser or provide any information about themselves or their material when applying a CC license to their material. Whether and to what extent these rights exist, and if so, how they are labeled, varies depending on the jurisdiction. On the internet, even the most basic activities involve making copies of copyrighted content.</p>

<h5 id="discuss-it">Discuss It</h5>

<p><em>A callout for a social prompt. It can be moved anywhere. Creators may also apply Creative Commons licenses to material they create that are adapted from public domain works, or to remixed material, databases, or collections that include work in the public domain.</em></p>

<p>Creative Commons does not recommend using a CC license on a logo or trademark. Yes—but if you change the terms and conditions of any Creative Commons license, you must no longer call, label, or describe the license as a &lsquo;Creative Commons&rsquo; or &lsquo;CC&rsquo; license, nor can you use the Creative Commons logos, buttons, or other trademarks in connection with the modified license or your materials. Creators may also apply Creative Commons licenses to material they create that are adapted from public domain works, or to remixed material, databases, or collections that include work in the public domain. (In France it is called a &lsquo;mandate&rsquo; of rights but has similar practical effect.)</p>

<p>That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in copyright law, and many members of the Creative Commons community are active participants in the copyright reform movement. Our tools are free, and our reach is wide. (Note that charging for access may not be permitted with NC-licensed material; however, it is not disallowed by the restriction on ETMs.)Because there is no single &lsquo;Creative Commons license,&rsquo; it is important to identify which of the six licenses you are applying to your material, which of the six licenses has been applied to material that you intend to use, and in both cases the specific version. Yes.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-creative-commons-licenses-expire">When do Creative Commons licenses expire?</h3>

<p>Creators in these jurisdictions who belong to collecting societies may not be able to license their material under CC licenses because the collecting societies own the necessary rights, not the creators.</p>

<p>Central to our licenses is the grant of a standard set of permissions in advance, without requiring users to ask for permission or seek clarification before using the work. There are currently no ports of 4.0, and it is planned that few, if any, will be created. You do not need to register with Creative Commons to apply a CC license to your material; it is legally valid as soon as you apply it to any material you have the legal right to license. How do I apply a Creative Commons license to my material?</p>

<p><em>Callout to add something. Make it good.

<p>If and only if your particular use is one that would require permission, you should note the following. CC offers resources on the best practices for marking your material and on how to mark material in different media (.pdf). CC licenses contain a &lsquo;severability&rsquo; clause. Among other things, if you use the logos on a website or on your work, you may not alter the logos in any respect—such as by changing the font, the proportions, or the colors.</p>

Adding them to your toolkit makes them easy to find and use when the need arises, and makes it easy for you to pass on resources you consider important to others.

<h5 id="discuss-it-1">Discuss It</h5>

<p><em>Another callout for a social prompt. CC provides tools to make it easier for creators and owners to say which rights they reserve and permissions they grant.

<p>Generally, a modification rises to the level of an adaptation under copyright law when the modified work is based on the prior work but manifests sufficient new creativity to be copyrightable, such as a translation of a novel from one language to another, or the creation of a screenplay based on a novel. If your use is not one that requires permission under the license, you may conduct text and data mining activity without regard to the above considerations. the minute you put pen to paper, take a photo, or hit the &lsquo;save&rsquo; button on your computer).</p>

<p>The first question to ask is whether doing so constitutes an adaptation. CC has a brief guide to interpretation of the NC license that goes into more detail about the meaning of the NC license and some key points to pay attention to.</p>

<p>Because there is no single &lsquo;Creative Commons license,&rsquo; it is important to identify which of the six licenses you are applying to your material, which of the six licenses has been applied to material that you intend to use, and in both cases the specific version.
